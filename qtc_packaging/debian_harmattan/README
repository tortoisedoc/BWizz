The Debian Package bookmarkwizard
----------------------------

This package includes a tool to edit, remove, export bookmarks.

Currently supported browsers:
 - Nokia in-built browser
 - Opera
 - Firefox

WARNING : might break your bookmarks if used unappropriately. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

KNOWN ISSUES :
--------------------
*Firefox:
  There is a known issue in exporting FavIcons to Firefox;
  FF identifies FavIcons as "<websiteurl>/favicon.ico";
  BWizz exports the FavIcon as "<bookmarkurl>/favicon.ico";
  thus, if the Bookmark's URL does not match with the actual FavIcon's website url,
  Firefox will "reload" the FavIcon from the website, overriding the exported one.
  WORKAROUNDS:
	- Export, load the website in FF and then reedit the FavIcon in BWizz;
